            <p>Hi, Welcome to Coding Quiz. I am going to generate a series of code related Questions, try to answer as many as you can before the timer runs out. <br> 
                For every answer you get correct you will be awarded 10 points, but be careful because every answer that is incorrect will deduct 5 points and <br>
                5 seconds from your remaing time. Good Luck & May the Odds be ever in your favor. </p>

    <!--I need to create a container for High Scores. User should be able to click and view. This means I will have to create a button. **Ref ASWTLJS**-->
    <!--YOU CAN DO THIS - BREAK IT DOWN- ONE STEP AT A TIME--> <!--check resources on how to build a list. **w3Schools -use <ol> to create a ordered list**-->
    <!--You may want to consider changing the names to make each container a little more uniqe, this may get very confusing-->

        <div class="High-Scores-Container">
